# Testing

All incoming pull requests are tested using [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) as
part of the CI process. This ensures that the latest version of the API is always stable on all supported platforms. You
can run the full suite of automated checks and tests locally using the following command:

```bash
nox -r
```
